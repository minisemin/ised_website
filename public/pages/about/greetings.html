            Our Department of Innovative Science and Engineering is a graduate program affiliated with
            the Department of Integrated Science and Engineering (ISED) at Underwood International College,
            Yonsei University. Department of Innovative Science and Engineering has been established in
            2024 to encompass nanoscience engineering (NSE), energy and environmental engineering (EESE),
            and bio-convergence (BC) majors under the keyword of innovative science, aiming for innovation
            in both the development of science technology and education.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to the advancement of science and technology in the rapidly changing modern society,
             infinite possibilities and challenges in the fields of science and engineering, such as
             nanomaterials, artificial intelligence, eco-friendly energy, and advanced biotechnology,
             are unfolding before us. Our Department of Innovative Science and Engineering focuses on
              innovative convergence research to proactively and eagerly respond to these changes and
               challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Department of Innovative Science and Engineering pursues the essence of scholarship
            that harmonizes tradition and innovation. We build innovative ideas on our historically
            established academic foundation and conduct creative research that merges the boundaries
            of science and engineering. Hence, we aim to ensure that science and technology research
            and education can contribute to the sustainable development of future society, and in
            particular, we have planned a program that can fully support the passion and efforts of
            students moving toward their goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yonsei University's Department of Innovation Science and Engineering will keep moving
            forward with efforts toward this vision and goal. We invite you on a journey of innovation
            and development as we prepare for the future together. Thank you.
